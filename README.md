##  Overview

This repository contains a team-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) project developed as part of our Ideathon participation.

Our goal is to:

> Analyze an e-commerce dataset, uncover patterns, visualize insights, and collaboratively build a clean analytical portfolio using Git, GitHub workflows, and Jupyter Notebooks.



Each team member contributes individual analyses through feature branches and pull requests, ensuring a professional and conflict-free workflow.

##  Dataset Description

The dataset consists of multiple features representing real user activity on an e-commerce platform. Below are the key attributes:

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AccessDate** | Date & time when the user accessed the website |
| **DurationSeconds** | Total time spent on the platform |
| **NetworkProtocol** | Indicates whether the user accessed via HTTP/HTTPS |
| **IPAddress** | Masked IP region of the user |
| **BytesConsumed** | Total data consumed during the session |
| **Browser** | Browser used (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) |
| **Age** | Age of the user |
| **Gender** | Gender information |
| **Country** | Location of the user |
| **Membership** | Normal or Premium membership type |
| **Language** | Website language selected |
| **Sales** | Sales amount generated |
| **Returned** | Whether a product return took place |
| **ReturnedAmount** | Amount refunded for returns |
| **PaymentMethod** | Mode of payment (UPI, Card, COD, etc.) |

This structured dataset allows for meaningful segmentation, behavioural analysis, and performance insights.

---

##  Objectives

* Clean and preprocess the dataset
* Identify behavioural & demographic trends
* Visualize patterns using effective plots
* Understand the business impact of attributes (age, country, browser, etc.)
* Perform comparative analysis across different user groups
* Build a high-quality, structured, collaborative data-science repository
* Showcase teamwork, analysis skills, and Git/GitHub workflow mastery
